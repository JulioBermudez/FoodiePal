# FoodiePal

The Food Recipe App is a simple web application that allows users to browse and search for various food recipes. It displays a list of recipes with their names and ingredients, and users can also perform a search to find specific recipes based on their input.

## Features

- View a list of food recipes with their names and ingredients.
- Load and display all recipes with a single click of the "Load Recipes" button.
- Search for recipes by entering a keyword in the search box and clicking the "Search" button.
- The search results will be displayed below the search box in a list format.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for the basic structure of the web page.
- CSS: Used for styling the page layout and elements.
- JavaScript: Used for dynamic content generation and handling user interactions.
- jQuery: Used to simplify DOM manipulation and event handling.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Upon opening the web page, you will see a "Food Recipe App" heading, a "Load Recipes" button, and a search section with an input field and a "Search" button.

4. Click on the "Load Recipes" button to display the initial list of recipes.

5. To search for a specific recipe, enter a keyword related to the recipe you are looking for in the search input field.

6. Click on the "Search" button to perform the search.

7. The search results will be displayed below the search section in a list format.

## Sample Recipe Data

The Food Recipe App uses a sample set of recipe data stored in the `recipesData` JavaScript array. Each recipe object in the array has two properties:

- `name`: The name of the recipe (string).
- `ingredients`: An array of ingredients used in the recipe (array of strings).

In a real application, this data would be fetched from a server or a database.

## Note

This is a basic example of a food recipe app and may not have complete features or backend integration. It serves as a starting point for further development and customization.
