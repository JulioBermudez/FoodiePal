## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Upon opening the web page, you will see a "Food Recipe App" heading, a "Load Recipes" button, and a search section with an input field and a "Search" button.

4. Click on the "Load Recipes" button to display the initial list of recipes.

## Sample Recipe Data

The Food Recipe App uses a sample set of recipe data stored in the `recipesData` JavaScript array. Each recipe object in the array has two properties:

- `name`: The name of the recipe (string).
- `ingredients`: An array of ingredients used in the recipe (array of strings).

In a real application, this data would be fetched from a server or a database.

## Note

This is a basic example of a food recipe app and may not have complete features or backend integration. It serves as a starting point for further development and customization.
